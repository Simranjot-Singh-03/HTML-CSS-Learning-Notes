## HTML & CSS Learning Notes

This project contains my personal learning notes for HTML and CSS.
It explains different topics with examples such as:
- CSS Types
- Forms
- Tables
- Basic HTML Concepts

The notes are designed like small web pages,
so they can be opened in a browser and studied easily.
